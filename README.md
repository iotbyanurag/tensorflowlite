## Introduction

Object detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates objects in an image or video. This project uses TensorFlow Lite, a lightweight library designed for mobile and embedded devices, to run object detection on a Raspberry Pi 5.

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 5
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module V3
- MicroSD card (32GB recommended)
- Power supply for Raspberry Pi
- Internet connection (for downloading models and updates)

## Software Requirements

- Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye recommended)
- Python 3.7 or later
- TensorFlow Lite
- OpenCV
- Git

## Setup

### Raspberry Pi OS Installation

1. Download and install the Raspberry Pi Imager from the [official website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/).
2. Flash the Raspberry Pi OS to the MicroSD card.
3. Insert the MicroSD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

### Enabling the Camera

1. Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
2. Run `sudo raspi-config`.
3. Navigate to `Interfacing Options` > `Camera` and enable the camera.
4. Reboot the Raspberry Pi.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
